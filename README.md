# Hordes.Auction

The source code for the (now offline) website Hordes.Auction, a tool to help players sell their in game items.

## How to run:
```npm start```

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

```npm run build```

Builds a static copy of your site to the `build/` folder.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

I have no intentions of doing any further development on this project, but anyone is free to pick it up where I left off.
